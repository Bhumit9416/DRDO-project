# Directed Energy Weapon Dashboard

## 📡 Overview

This repository contains the full-stack **Directed Energy Weapon (DEW) Dashboard**, developed as part of my internship project at **DRDO ISSA**.  
It provides an interactive platform to visualize, track, and analyze data related to Directed Energy Weapon systems, including:

- Types and specifications of DEWs (HEL, HPM, particle beams)
- Deployment status and operational ranges
- Real-time data charts and technical metrics
- Comparative analytics on regional defense developments

The goal is to deliver a secure, modular web dashboard to aid defense research and strategic studies on DEW capabilities.
